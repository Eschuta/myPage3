	<h1>Godzilla Minus One Review</h1>
	</header>
	
	<main>
	<p>This is easily the best Godzilla film I’ve seen, and there’s multiple reasons for that accolade. The period setting, 1947, is unexpected and ripe with possibilities,
	returning the Godzilla mythology to the aftermath of WWII, and presenting the monster in a fearsome, primal state, about to stomp Tokyo with huge loss of human life. So
	forget all that ‘Godzilla is our friend’ stuff, Godzilla is about as much your bestie as Jaws the shark. One brief attack scene leaves an estimated 30,000 dead, so Godzilla
	is very much the spectre of mass destruction in Japan post WWII, which feels right. That sense of gravity extends to the storyline, which doesn’t feature a single line of
	dialogue which mentions Godzilla for the first half hour as we consider the shame of kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who doesn’t go out with a blaze of
	glory as WWII ends. ‘Why die honourably now?’ he asks, and he’s got a point.</p>
	<p>His misery and disgrace is compounded by failing to shoot down a young Godzilla, who does have a brief cameo in the second scene, but his presence isn’t discussed; it’s
	an odd world where kaiju are taken for granted, and its just their management that anyone is concerned about. Our hero starts a life amongst the wreckage, adopting a partner
	and a baby, but to feed them requires employment, and he gets a dangeous job, trying to avoid and defuse magnetic mines from a wooden boat floating in the sea. That occupation
	brings us into Godzilla’s orbit, and soon we’re getting into the familiar territory of trying to stop the raging, rampant creature from demolishing the city…</p>
	<p>Godzilla Minus One offers consistently interesting, novel takes on elements that were fairly rote in previous versions, like national identity. ‘This country never changes,
	I wonder if it can,’ one character muses, while another reacts to discussion of a gag order by saying ‘Information control is the only thing this country’s good at.’ That
	thoughtful quality extends to the main character, who is infused by personal guilt, but also a determination to be part of his country’s recovery. ‘I let that thing kill
	everyone,’ he says about his failure to stop the initial massacre, ‘Why did I think I could dream again?’ Godzilla’s regenerative properties have a metaphorical meaning here;
	the more weapons are used to fight Godzilla, the stronger Godzilla’s regeneration is, so there’s a strong enviromental angle, again, a subtext which was always in these movies,
	but never so smartly expressed.</p>
    <p>In this particular alternative reality, Japan can dream again, they just have to experience and show the resolve of ordinary citizens to overcome a further collective trauma
	first; ‘the war isn’t over yet’ we’re told, but a mass effort is the only way rid the country of the collective rage manifestation that is embodied by Godzilla. The practicalities
	of monster control make up the second half of the film, which is far more involving and emotional than a Godzilla movie might be expected to be. With striking special effects,
	a fearsome monster, much ingenuity and a strong political viewpoint, Godzilla Minus One really is quite a reboot, and certainly puts the goofy Hollywood version to shame.</p>
